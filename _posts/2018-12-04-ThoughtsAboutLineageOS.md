## Thoughts:
First and foremost, the daily builds are both annoying and extremely nice! 
    
    1. I really appreciate the knowledge that work is still being actively done on the operating system
        -Unfortunately, my knowledge here is mostly security theater without knowing what changes are in the updates I am installing
    2. Simply on priciple, I like having root access on any device that I own!
    3. The phone subjectively works better
        -Though, I have noticed lagging in similar places to before (like the maps app)
    4. I really like having access to the recovery media!
        I also like the openness of the update process! 

## Conclusions:
I am strongly considering flashing the OS of my Pixel XL to LineageOS also!
    I would like to find the daily build logs for each release and what changes are in them! 
    Finally, I am curious how updating between android versions will go and whether I need to manually do so or not.
